This project is made using Bootstrap and ReactJS in front end. This project is hosted using an amazon aws ec-2 server.

The Front end has been built using Bootstrap and ReactJS. Design is responsive. Validations have been done.
\home - Here you can select start and end dates along with car seating capacity. Based on this a list of available cars will be shown. You can book any of them.
\menu - All transactions can be viewed.
\bookacar - Booking page opened once you select car in home page.

Some cars have already been added for convenience.

The project uses alert to show prompts to users. Due to the blocking nature of alerts, some api calls like loading cars in home isn't working in safari and mozilla. But the website is fully functional in Chrome. Please run the project in Chrome. Since this was my first ever project and I did all the development in chrome I wasn't aware of this issue,.
